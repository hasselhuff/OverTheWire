## Commands you may need to solve this level

-----------------

From the [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) page:
> username: bandit0
>
> password: bandit0
> 
> server: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
> 
> port: 2220

I ssh'ed into the server using:
```bash
ssh -l bandit0 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

1. Ran an `ls` to list the contents of `bandit0`'s home directory
2. Noticed a file called `readme`.
3. Concatenated  the `readme` file with `cat`
```bash
cat readme
```
Which uncovers bandit1's password.
