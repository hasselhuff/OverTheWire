ssh into the server:
```bash
ssh -l bandit3 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

1. Ran `ls` with the `l` and `a` options on the `inhere` directory to show all items including hidden items in long format
```bash
ls -la inhere
```
2. Noticed a file called `.hidden` in the directory
3. Concatenate the hidden file
```bash
cat inhere/.hidden
```
