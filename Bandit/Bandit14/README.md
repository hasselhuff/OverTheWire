ssh into the server:
```bash
ssh -l bandit14 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

1. Ran the following command:
```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 30000
```
2. I used `nc` since it can read and send data to network connections and needed to send the current password to the localhost's (127.0.0.1) port 30000
3. After I entered the command my cursor only blinked on a new line, so I entered Bandit14's password and hit enter:
```bash
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
```
4. I was then given the output:
```bash
Correct!
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
```
Bandit15's password: BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
