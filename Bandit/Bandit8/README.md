ssh into the server:
```bash
ssh -l bandit8 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

1. Ran the following command with:
```bash
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
```
> Note:
> `sort` will sort the output of `cat data.txt` in descending order
> 
> `|` redirects the output from the previous command and sends it into the following command
> 
> `uniq` will show every unique line that is in the data
> 
> `uniq -u` will only show unique lines that are only displayed one time in the data
2. The result of the above command gave me the output:
```bash
