ssh into the server:
```bash
ssh -l bandit10 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

1. Ran the following command:
```bash
cat data.txt | base64 -d
```
> Note:
> `base64` by itself encodes the given input into base64, since the data was already in base64 I used the `-d` switch to decode the data from base64
> 
2. The result of the above command gave me the output:
```bash
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
```


Bandit11's password: IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
